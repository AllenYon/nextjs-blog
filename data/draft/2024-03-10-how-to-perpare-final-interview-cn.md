## 4. 你能分享一下你的职业规划吗？

With more than 10 years in software development, I've deeply understood computer science and developed a strong love for coding. I'm proud of the impact my work has had and I'm excited to keep making contributions. I'm skilled in many areas of programming, from Android/iOS to React Native, backend development, and machine learning. I view every technology as a tool to creatively solve problems. Although I'm open to new tech, focusing on my current role is my main goal.

## 5. Share a project you are proud of.

In my previous startup, we were a young, agile team working on a new project. Since technical debt was minimal, I championed the use of React Native for development. This allowed us to leverage a single codebase for both Android and iOS, significantly accelerating our development timeline.
I also spearheaded the implementation of several infrastructure systems used at [Previous Company Name], like an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) system. This provided real-time user performance and stability data, enabling us to proactively identify and address issues.
Additionally, I introduced a CI/CD pipeline, which automated tasks like compilation, testing, and deployment. This freed up developer time and streamlined our development process.
By tackling historical problems like unreliable user notifications and memory leaks, we were able to improve user retention. These efforts culminated in the project's successful on-time launch, which generated immediate user traction and order volume. This project remains a significant source of personal accomplishment for me.

- At my previous startup, we were a small team launching a new project. With little technical debt, I pushed for using React Native, enabling us to write one codebase for both Android and iOS, which sped up our work.
- I led the setup of essential systems at Hellobike, such as an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) system, giving us live data on user experience and stability. This helped us quickly find and fix issues.
- I also introduced a CI/CD pipeline, automating compilation, testing, and deployment, saving time and making our process smoother.
- By solving issues like unreliable notifications and memory leaks, we boosted user retention.
- Our project launched on time, gained quick user interest, and increased orders. This achievement is a highlight of my career.

## 6. Let us know about a time when you made a mistake at work.

- When working at Mogujie, we suddenly encountered an App crash problem one night. There were not many, but it was better to fix it as soon as possible.
- I fixed it at home, but I didn't have enough test phones to verify it, and I just tried my luck and released the code using hotfix technology.
- The crash got even worse the next day, so I urgently fixed the problem.
- I always remember this accident. It made me realize that as software engineers, we should abide by rules and regulations, take every code release seriously, and maintain a sense of respect for customers.

## 7. If you were working in the Software Engineer role, what are some of the key success indicators you would keep in mind?

It's important to note that the specific KPIs you'll focus on will vary depending on your role and company. However, keeping these broad categories in mind will help you understand how you're performing and areas for improvement.

- Code Quality and Maintainability: This can be measured through code reviews, the coverage of automated tests, and the long-term maintenance costs. High-quality and maintainable code often means fewer bugs and easier feature iterations.
- Project Delivery Timeliness: Completing projects on time is a critical measure of success. This includes finishing tasks within the set timeframe and meeting all project requirements and quality standards.
- Team Collaboration and Communication: Software development is a team effort. Effective communication, positive team collaboration, and conflict resolution skills are crucial for project success.
- User Satisfaction and Feedback: Feedback from users is one of the key indicators of software success. This includes user satisfaction surveys, application usage frequency, and user retention rates.
- Technical Leadership and Innovation: Staying ahead technically, continually learning new technologies, and applying them to projects are another important aspect of assessing a software engineer's success. This also includes the ability to innovate solutions to increase efficiency, reduce costs, or enhance user value.
- Performance Metrics and System Stability: Ensuring high performance and stability of the software is vital for the user experience. This can be measured by monitoring the application's response times, failure rates, and availability.

## 9. Give an example of a time you had to resolve a conflict

Background:

- During my work at Hellobike, I led Project A, which aimed to upgrade the version of Gradle in all libraries. As the project manager and a core developer, I had to coordinate the work of other colleagues.
- At the same time I'm also a team member of Project B . At the beginning, the two projects had no resource conflicts .

Challenge:

- But there were some problems due to the changes of time and staffs, If we didn't fix it, both projects would have been delayed.

Action:
To resolve the conflict, I took the following steps:

- After comparing projectA and B, I decided to complete Project A firstly because I was the leader of it. This way, we could ensure both projects would be completed on time.
- Communication and Coordination: I discussed my plan with the leader of Project B and the team manager to ensure everyone understood the conflict and my solution.
- Solution: Following our discussion, we agreed to postpone Project B firstly to ensure completing Project A. And then allocate additional resources to Project B.

Outcome:

- Both projects were completed on time.

Conclusion:

- This experience showed me how common resource conflicts are in project management. It also taught me skills like prioritizing tasks, communicating well, and working together to solve problems.

## 13. How did you come to find out you needed a new job?

Here are several situations that would make me consider seeking a new job:

1. Position-related reasons:
   The work becomes meaningless, repetitive, and lacks challenges and opportunities for growth.
2. Company or industry-related reasons:
   The industry I am in is affected by factors such as the pandemic, government policies, and new technologies, leading to market contraction or facing 淘汰.

## 16. 你的最大缺点和最大优点是什么？

Advantages: Rich Android development experience and project experience, able to complete projects independently
Disadvantages: Current English level is not good enough and needs to be improved. I don’t know much about the North American workplace, so it may take some time to get used to it.

## 17. What was your most innovative idea? How did you come up with it, and how did you implement it?

Please tell me something about you that is not in your resume.

In the past two months, I have been trying to find a job while trying to develop some saas products as income projects. I read a piece of news about the December Project, where users submit the full name, relationship, story and other information of a deceased relative, and then the website will simulate this relative to chat with you.
After I searched and tried several similar projects, I thought it would be better if I could add analog sound, so I tried to use elevenlabs' API plus openai's API to write a demo, and I felt the effect was good. I have been working on this project recently, but it has not been launched yet.

## 18.In your present job, how do you handle your workload?

- In order to effectively manage my workload, I usually use some tools to manage, such as Google Calendar to manage schedules,
- Gantt charts to manage project progress, and weekly or daily project reports to manage and report workload.
- At the same time, I will use some Todo software to manage the priorities of daily tasks.
- Determining the priority of tasks can also help us improve efficiency. Usually I will divide it into 4 levels
  1. Urgent and important
  2. Urgent but not important
  3. Not urgent but important
  4. Not urgent or important
- Emphasizing the importance of teamwork, in our previous work, we would hold a short morning stand-up meeting every day to discuss project progress and task allocation to ensure that everyone could contribute effectively.
- When faced with a heavy workload, I value staying calm and focused. I ensure to take regular breaks to think clearly and recharge, which helps maintain the quality and efficiency of my work. Additionally, I communicate with my manager to ensure expectations are realistic and seek the necessary support or resources.

## 19. Can you share an example of a time when you made an unpopular decision
