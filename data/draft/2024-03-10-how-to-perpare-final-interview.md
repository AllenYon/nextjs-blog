## 2. 你为什么想加入我们公司？

首先，我知道 instacart 是一家为用户提供当日送货服务的在线杂货配送平台，公司 2012 年成立，2021 年上市，是目前北美最大的杂货配送平台,行业领先地位
我非常看好贵公司和这个行业的发展前景，人类社会的分工就是越来越细，随着科学技术的发展，比如自动驾驶和自动化机器人的出现，对于杂货配送的需求也是越来越大，我们不需要浪费时间去超市购物，而是可以把时间花在更有意义的事情上, 所以这是一个非常有意义的行业。

其实，instacart 目前提供的这个职位非常符合我的职业规划，我有着 10 多年的 Android 原生开发经验，我也非常乐意继续从事这个领域的工作.
由于我工作经验和项目经验丰富，比如我在电商领域，共享出行行业的公司工作过，与 instacart 的业务模式有一定的相似之处，所以我相信我可以完全独立的完成工作，同时去挑战一些有难度的问题，我相信我的经验能够为公司做出贡献。

最后就是我觉得目前的公司员工文化 flex first 非常符合我现在的状态，我目前生活在 halifax，我夫人正在 smu 完成她的硕士学业，短期还无法离开 halifax，远程工作是我目前非常需要的工作类型。

First of all, I know that Instacart is an online grocery delivery platform that provides users with same-day delivery services. The company was established in 2012 and has been listed on NASDAQ. It is currently the largest grocery delivery platform in North America and has a leading position in the industry.
I am very optimistic about the development prospects of your company and this industry, because the division of labor in human society is becoming more and more detailed. With the development of science and technology, such as the emergence of autonomous driving and automated robots, the demand for grocery delivery is also increasing.
We don't need to waste time going to supermarkets for shopping, but can spend our time on more meaningful things, so this is a very meaningful industry.

Secondly, the position currently offered by instacart is very consistent with my career plan. I have more than 10 years of experience in Android native development, and I am very happy to continue working in this field.

Since I have worked in companies in e-commerce, shared travel and other industries, and have certain similarities with Instacart's business model, I believe that I can complete the work independently and challenge some difficult problems at the same time.

Finally, I think the current company employee culture Flex First is very suitable for my current situation. I currently live in Halifax. My wife is completing her master's degree at SMU and cannot leave Halifax in the short term. Remote work is the type of job that I need very much at the moment. .

## 3. 你能描述一下你的工作经历吗？

大学毕业后，2014 年我非常有幸的加入了一家小型创业电商平台公司蘑菇街，当时中国的互联网发展非常快速，我随着公司的快速成长，我个人的能力和经验也得到了很大的提升。
在蘑菇街，我主要负责了蘑菇街 Android 客户端的开发工作，我参与了蘑菇街 Android 客户端的整体架构设计，负责了蘑菇街 Android 客户端的核心模块的开发工作，包括首页、商品详情页、购物车、订单等核心模块的开发工作。
2019 年蘑菇街开始走下坡路之后，我跳槽到了 HelloBike，这是一家做共享出行的公司，我在这里负责了 HelloBike Android 客户端的开发工作，负责了 HelloBike App 的首页和顺风车核心模块开发，同时参与基础架构建设，比如编译插件，APM，H5 容器，性能稳定性优化等等
2022 年我和夫人准备移民加拿大，我的一位前同事创业做了一款语音视频社交平台，我和他商量之后，他同意我远程工作的方式，我在这里负责了一款新产品的从 0 到 1 的全部开发工作，使用了新的跨平台 ReactNative 技术。

After graduating from college, I was very fortunate to join Mogujie, a small entrepreneurial e-commerce platform company, in 2014. At that time, China's Internet industry was developing very rapidly. With the rapid growth of the company, my personal abilities and experience also grew rapidly.

At Mogujie, I mainly participated in the development of Mogujie Android App. Some core modules include homepage, product details page, shopping cart, order management, payment, etc.

After Mogujie began to decline in 2019, I switched jobs to HelloBike, a company that provides shared travel. Here I was responsible for the development of the HelloBike Android client, such as the homepage, taxi and shared car modules.
At the same time, he participates in the research and development of mobile app infrastructure, such as compiling plug-ins, APM, H5 containers, performance stability optimization, etc.

In 2022, I switched to a startup company of a former colleague and redeveloped a voice and video social software from 0 to 1, using the new cross-platform ReactNative technology. With that I got the opportunity to work remotely and we ended up in Canada.

## 4. 你能分享一下你的职业规划吗？

从大的范围来说，目前我已经工作了 10 多年的时间，现在正是经验最丰富的时候，同时我也非常热爱编程，从事这个工作我觉得我产生了很大的价值，所以我希望继续从事软件研发工作
从小范围来说，不管是 Android/iOS 原生编程，还是 ReactNative 跨平台编程，还是服务端编程，或者机器学习这样更大的技术栈，他们都是解决用户问题的方式之一，
有机会我当然希望可以尝试不同的技术栈，但是我会先把目前的事情做好。

With over 10 years of experience in the software development field, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of the industry and a deep passion for programming. I take pride in the value I've delivered through my work and am eager to continue contributing to this field.

I'm proficient in various programming domains, including native Android/iOS development, cross-platform solutions like React Native, server-side programming, and even machine learning. I see each technology stack as a valuable tool for solving user problems in creative ways.

While I'm always interested in exploring new technologies, my current priority remains excelling in my present role.

## 5. Share a project you are proud of.

在上一家创业公司，做语音视频社交平台的公司时，由于是新项目，技术债务比较少，我说服了管理层和同事尝试使用 ReactNative+Native 的开发技术栈，这样子做的好处就是一份代码可以同时运行在 Android/iOS 平台之上，加快了项目的研发速度，
同时我将在 Hellobike 中使用到的一些基础架构系统，引入了进来。比如 APM 技术，这样子我们可以在线上监控用户的使用情况，及时发现问题，解决问题，提高了用户体验。
比如 CI/CD 系统，将编译测试交付等工作从本地搬到了云服务器上执行，提高了开发效率。
同时解决了一些历史遗留问题，比如用户通知触达和内存泄露问题，提高了用户的留存率。
最后，这个项目按时顺利上线之后，立刻就有了用户使用和订单产生，是我非常有成就感的项目之一

In my previous startup, we were a young, agile team working on a new project. Since technical debt was minimal, I championed the use of React Native for development. This allowed us to leverage a single codebase for both Android and iOS, significantly accelerating our development timeline.

I also spearheaded the implementation of several infrastructure systems used at [Previous Company Name], like an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) system. This provided real-time user performance and stability data, enabling us to proactively identify and address issues.

Additionally, I introduced a CI/CD pipeline, which automated tasks like compilation, testing, and deployment. This freed up developer time and streamlined our development process.

By tackling historical problems like unreliable user notifications and memory leaks, we were able to improve user retention. These efforts culminated in the project's successful on-time launch, which generated immediate user traction and order volume. This project remains a significant source of personal accomplishment for me.

## 6. Let us know about a time when you made a mistake at work.

I want to know what you learned from your major failure at work.

当我还在蘑菇街工作的时候，有一次因为我的原因，造成了一次比较重大的线上事故。
当时我们使用了热更新技术来修复线上 crash 问题，由于这个线上故障发现的已经比较晚，我就准备回到家操作。
完成修复工作后，我们需要使用设备来测试验证，但是家里只有一台，并没有充分验证，我因为侥幸心理就发布上线了。
第二天这个 crash 变得更加严重，我紧急再次修复这个问题
这个事故我一直记住，让我意识到了作为软件工程师, 我们应该严肃对待每次代码发布，遵守规则制度，对线上用户保持敬畏之心。

While working at Mogujie, I encountered an App Crash problem. It was not a big problem, so I planned to use hot fix technology to fix it.
Since I was repairing it at home and didn't have enough test phones to verify it, I took a chance and released the code online.
The crash became more serious the next day, and I urgently fixed the problem again.
I always remember this accident, which made me realize that as software engineers, we should abide by the rules and regulations, take every code release seriously, and maintain a sense of respect for online users.

## 7. If you were working in the Software Engineer role, what are some of the key success indicators you would keep in mind?

对于关键成功指标我们可以分为两类来讨论，一类是非技术类的，一类是技术类的。

非技术类型的 我觉得最重要的应该是解决问题的能力，不单单是技术问题，还可能是业务问题或者团队协作问题，
其次是沟通协作能力，因为通常一个大项目都是多人跨团队合作完成的，所以沟通协作能力非常重要。
适应性和学习能力也很重要，因为技术行业是不断变化的，我们需要不断学习新的技术，新的知识。

对于技术上的关键成功指标，
首先，我会关注代码质量和代码可维护度，比如利用 sonarqube 工具，我们就可以监控包括代码覆盖率，测试覆盖率，代码的可读性，代码的可维护性，代码的复杂度等等。
其实是研发效率，这里指标可以是开发周期，开发效率，开发质量等等。
最后是缺陷率和平均修复时间, 这些指标表示了你的代码质量和工作效率

Technical Skills:

1. Code Quality and Maintainability: This involves metrics like code coverage, which shows how thoroughly your code is tested, and code churn, which measures how often code needs to be rewritten.
2. Efficiency and Productivity: This can be tracked through cycle time (time to complete tasks) and velocity (amount of work delivered in a period).
3. Defect Rate and Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): A low defect rate and a fast MTTR indicate you can identify and fix bugs quickly.

Non-Technical Skills:

1. Communication and Collaboration: This includes your ability to explain technical concepts clearly, collaborate effectively with teammates, and participate in code reviews.
2. Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking: Your skill at analyzing problems, identifying root causes, and developing creative solutions is essential.
3. Adaptability and Learning Agility: The tech industry is constantly evolving, so being able to learn new technologies and adapt to changing requirements is crucial.
   It's important to note that the specific KPIs you'll focus on will vary depending on your role and company. However, keeping these broad categories in mind will help you understand how you're performing and areas for improvement.

## 8. Please tell me something about you that is not in your resume.

我在这几个月的时间里，开发了几款和 AI 相关的 web 应用和 app 应用

## 9. Give an example of a time you had to resolve a conflict

Describe a time when you couldn't meet a deadline.

在 hellobike 工作时，其中一个季度确定 KPI 时，我发起了一个项目 A，项目目标是完成所有 Android 类库的 Gradle 升级，我既是项目负责人，也是核心研发人员，这个项目工作量很大，协调其他同事的工作。
同时我还要参与另外一个项目，作为参与人，两个项目没有资源上的冲突，且是同时进行的， 时间是 2 个月。
但是后来由于一些变动，导致两个项目上的时间和人力资源上有了冲突，我如果不解决这个问题，两个项目都会延期。
这里就是作为项目管理人员或者研发人员经常遇到的资源冲突问题，解决办法无非就是确定事务优先级，重新分配资源，或者延期，或者增加资源。
由于我是项目 A 的负责人，我需要优先确保这个项目顺利完成，于是我和项目 B 的负责人，还是团队领导进行了沟通，最后我们决定延期项目 B 的时间 ，同时增加了项目 B 的人力资源，最后两个项目都按时完成了。

Background:

During my tenure at Hellobike, I led Project A, which aimed to upgrade all Android libraries to Gradle. As the project manager and a core developer, I had to coordinate the work of other colleagues while simultaneously participating in Project B as a team member. The two projects had no resource conflicts and were scheduled to run concurrently for two months.

Challenge:

Unforeseen changes led to time and manpower clashes between the two projects. Failure to address this issue would have delayed both projects.

Action:

To resolve the conflict, I took the following steps:

Prioritization: Being the project lead for Project A, I prioritized its successful completion.
Communication and Coordination: I communicated with Project B's lead and the team leader, explaining the conflict situation.
Solution Formulation: After discussion, we decided to postpone Project B while increasing its manpower allocation.
Outcome:

Both projects were completed on schedule.

Conclusion:

This experience highlighted the prevalence of resource conflicts in project management and equipped me with the skills to effectively address them through prioritization, communication, and solution-oriented collaboration.

## 11. Describe an occasion when you took ownership

在 kongkong 的时候，我是如何主导新项目开发的，如何主动引入新技术，新解决方案，帮助公司快速上线项目，获取成功

## 13. How did you come to find out you needed a new job?

什么情况下你觉得要找一份新工作了，这个问题我觉得是一个很好的问题，因为这个问题可以让面试官了解你的职业规划，你的职业发展方向，你的职业目标等等。

我觉得我需要找一份新工作的时候，主要有以下几个原因：

1. 职位原因，比如这个工作变得毫无意义，一直在重复同样的事情，没有成长空间。 虽然现在 AI 的出现，出现了 AI 可能代替软件工程师的声音，而且 AI 大大提升了软件工程师的工作效率，市场需求确实变小了，但是时间还没到。
2. 公司或者行业原因，比如这个行业收到疫情，国家政策，新技术等影响，市场在萎缩，行业被淘汰，那就可以考虑换个新行业了。 比如蘑菇街在市场竞争中被淘汰了，继续待下去也不会有什么起色。
3. 个人原因，比如我要移民到其他国家，换个新的环境

Here are several situations that would make me consider seeking a new job:

1. Position-related reasons:
   The work becomes meaningless, repetitive, and lacks challenges and opportunities for growth.
2. Company or industry-related reasons:
   The industry I am in is affected by factors such as the pandemic, government policies, and new technologies, leading to market contraction or facing 淘汰.
3. Personal reasons:
   For example, I need to immigrate to another country and need to change to a new working environment.

## 14. Describe a time you disagreed with a coworker but had to cooperate to get a project done.

## 15. In your present job, how do you handle your workload?

## 16. 你的最大缺点和最大优点是什么？
