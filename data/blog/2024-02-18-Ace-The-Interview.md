If you have different opinions from a colleague, consider these steps:

Listen Actively: First, listen to their perspective fully without interrupting. Understanding their viewpoint is crucial.

Express Your Views Respectfully: Clearly and calmly present your own opinions, providing reasoning and evidence if necessary.

Seek Common Ground: Try to find aspects of the issue where you both agree. This can form a basis for a mutual understanding.

Be Open to Compromise: In many situations, a compromise may be the best solution. Be willing to adjust your stance if it leads to a constructive outcome.

Focus on Problem-Solving, Not Winning: Approach the disagreement as a problem to be solved collaboratively, not a battle to be won.

Agree to Disagree if Necessary: Sometimes, itâ€™s not possible to reach a consensus. In such cases, it might be best to respectfully acknowledge your differing views and move on.

Seek Feedback or Mediation: If you can't resolve the disagreement, consider involving a neutral third party, like a supervisor or a mediator, for guidance.

To effectively answer a question about a situation where you faced conflicting priorities during an interview, you should use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This method helps structure your response in a clear and concise way. Here's an example response:

Situation: "In my previous role as a project manager at XYZ Corp, I was overseeing the development of two major projects simultaneously. Both had tight deadlines, but due to unexpected staff shortages, it became clear that meeting both deadlines was going to be a challenge."

Task: "My task was to ensure the successful completion of both projects without compromising quality or missing deadlines."

Action: "To address this, I first prioritized tasks based on urgency and importance. I then re-assigned some responsibilities among the team to balance the workload more effectively. I also communicated with stakeholders to reset expectations where necessary, ensuring transparency about our situation. I implemented regular check-ins to monitor progress and adjust plans as needed."

Result: "As a result, we successfully completed both projects. The first project was delivered on time, and the second one had a minimal delay but with quality exceeding expectations. The clients were satisfied with our communication and the outcomes. This experience taught me valuable lessons in prioritization, team management, and effective communication."

This answer demonstrates your problem-solving skills, ability to prioritize, and effective communication, all of which are valuable in any role.
